# Write a program that calculates and displays the letter grade for a
# given numerical score (e.g., A, B, C, D, or F)
# based on the following grading scale:
# input- score - 89
# output- B
# A: 90-100
# B: 80-89
# C: 70-79
# D: 60-69
# F: 0-59

# If, elif, else


# Step 1

# Figure out the Inputs
# Input? int

scale = int(input("Enter the number you got!\n"))

# Step 2 & #
# # Print the output
# Logic
# print A -> if scale <= 100 and scale >= 90

# Step 3
if scale >= 90 and scale <= 100:
    print("Grade is A")
elif scale >= 80 and scale <= 89:
    print("grade is B")
elif scale >= 70 and scale <= 79:
    print("grade is C")
elif scale >= 60 and scale <= 69:
    print("grade is D")
elif scale >= 0 and scale <= 59:
    print("grade is F")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
